## 1.0.4_0 - 2020/09/07
- Last documented upstream change: 1.0.2 (2020-07-01):
	- Over 150 new HD textures! Includes many environment textures like hedges,
  	leaves, bark, rocks, pillars, tiles, ladders, ropes and more. See these
	screenshots for examples!
	- Improved performance and quality of the included shaders.
	- Now in the .DDS BC7 format which dramatically reduces file size and
  	improves performance without any noticable quality loss.
	- Even easier install, now there's no installer at all! Simply extract the
  	texture pack to your desktop and start using the provided "ZTP4K Dolphin
	Emulator.exe" file, which is a custom fork of Ishiiruka Dolphin.
	- Fixed some bugs (not golden bugs, sorry!)
