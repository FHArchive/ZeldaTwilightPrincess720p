## Installation


### 'Vanilla' Dolphin

#### All

First things first, configure Dolphin to use textures

- Options (Menu Bar) > Graphics Settings
- Advanced (Tab)
- (Utility) Load Custom Textures + (Utility - Optional) Prefetch Custom Textures

#### 4k/1080p

Download the pack from one of the links above

1. Download
2. Copy the `GZ2` Directory from `Zelda Twilight Princess 4K [version] (texture_size).zip\Zelda Twilight Princess 4K [version] (texture_size)\User\Load\Textures`
   to `..\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures`
3. Launch Dolphin

#### 720p

The best way to do this is probably to download `TwilightPrincess720p.7z` from
the releases

1. Download `TwilightPrincess720p.7z` from the releases
2. Copy the `TwilightPrincess720p` Directory to
   `..\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures`
3. Launch Dolphin

### Ishiiruka Dolphin

#### 4k/1080p

> There is no installation! A custom version of Dolphin called Ishiiruka Dolphin
> is provided alongside the texture pack. Simply extract the folder somewhere
> and start Dolphin using "ZTP4K Dolphin Emulator.exe". If you're on Mac or
> Linux, please manually download Ishiiruka Dolphin from this page for your
> operating system and copy all the folders from the texture pack over to your
> default Dolphin directory.

In short, download then unpack the zip file and run `ZTP4K Dolphin Emulator.exe`

#### 720p

Not really supported or tested but I'd assume:

1. Download the 1080p version
2. Unpack the zip file
3. Copy the `TwilightPrincess720p` Directory to
   `Zelda Twilight Princess 4K [version] (texture_size).zip\Zelda Twilight Princess 4K [version] (texture_size)\User\Load\Textures`
4. Run `ZTP4K Dolphin Emulator.exe`


### PNG Version

Tested to title screen only. Best to use dds version if at all possible.

#### 720p ONLY

The best way to do this is probably to download `TwilightPrincess720pPNG.7z`
from the releases

1. Download `TwilightPrincess720pPNG.7z` from the releases
2. Copy the `TwilightPrincess720pPNG` Directory to
   `..\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures`
3. Launch Dolphin
